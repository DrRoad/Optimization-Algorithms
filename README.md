Optimization Algorithms
===================

Hello!
Here you can find a collection of optimization methods implemented in Python.
It was created while studying at KPI, so as university task it works with 2D functions only, but you can easily change it.

One-dimensional methods:
- Svenn algorithm
- Davies-Svenn-Campy algorithm
- DSC-Powell algorithm
- Gold search
- Dichotomy method
- Bolzano method
- Newton search
- Chords method

Zero-dimensional methods (requires no derivative):
- Hook-Jeeves algorithm
- Rozenbrock algorithm

Methods using derivative:
- Fixed lambda gradient descent
- Fastest descent (Cauchy method)
- Advanced partan (parallel tangents) algorithm
- Newton method (requires second order derivative)
- Fletcher-Reeves method

Other methods:
- Davidson-Fletcher-Powell method
